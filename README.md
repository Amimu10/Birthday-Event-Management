## MCQ TEST


1. Answer: A: {}
   The code defines a variable greeting but contains a typo (greetign). Despite the typo, JavaScript is forgiving and still creates the variable. When you log greetign , it outputs an empty object ({}). This is because JavaScript initializes variables even if there's a typo, resulting in the variable being defined as an empty object.

2. Answer: C: 12
   Explanation: JavaScript performs type coercion when using the + operator. In the sum function, the number 1 is added to the string "2", resulting in the concatenation of the two values and producing the string "12".

3.Answer: A: ['üçï', 'üç´', 'ü•ë', 'üçî']
Explanation: The favoriteFood property of the info object initially references the first element of the food array. Modifying info.favoriteFood to "üçù" does not affect the original food array.

4. Answer: B: Hi there, undefined
   Explanation: The sayHi function expects a name parameter, but it is not provided when calling the function. As a result, name is undefined within the function, leading to the output "Hi there, undefined".

5. Answer: C: 3
   Explanation: The forEach loop iterates over each element in the nums array. The condition if (num) evaluates to true for all non-zero numbers. Therefore, each of the three non-zero elements (1, 2, 3) increments the count, resulting in a final count of 3. I appreciate your understanding.
